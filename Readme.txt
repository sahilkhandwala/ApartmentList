Interesting Problem to divide employees of ApartmentList into different Lunch Groups!

1. We have an option menu to add new members or generate the groups
2. Constraints is that group size can only be between 3 to 5 members
3. If we want to generate groups before adding sufficient members, we get an error message.
4. We need to remember the previous added members, we can store their information in a file
5. We read the file and shuffle the entire list of employees
6. If there are less than 6 members its a trivial answer
7. If there are exactly 6 members, we have 2 groups of 3 each
8. If there are 7 members, we can have group of 3 and 4
9. If there are more members we run our algorithm to output group no and their repsecive members!
